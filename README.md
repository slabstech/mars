 VR Map for Satellite Orbits

* Why
  * Being an astronaut has been a dream job for many kids. 
    Helping them see the outer space and show how space missions work is the idea for our team.

* Challenge
  * Imagine an Earth-orbiting satellite, or an Earth-to-Moon mission that requires an orbital transfer maneuver, 
    or a spacecraft in a cyclical orbit around Earth and Mars, or a deep space probe that traverses the asteroid belt.
    Understanding and visualizing sophisticated space missions isnâ€™t easy! 
    Your challenge is to create an interactive, virtual reality application that enables users to visualize a space
    mission including the mission concept, orbital trajectories, and mission timeline.

* Summary
  * Create a VR Map for Earth to Mars missions. Based on the future starship missions, 
    help to share knowledge on how the spacecrafts travel the distance between the planets.
